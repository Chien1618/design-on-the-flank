## Refresh and Cleanup

- **ScrollTrigger.refresh()** — recalculate positions (e.g. after DOM/layout changes, fonts loaded, or dynamic content). Automatically called on viewport resize, debounced 200ms. Refresh runs in creation order (or by **refreshPriority**); create ScrollTriggers top-to-bottom on the page or set **refreshPriority** so they refresh in that order.
- When removing animated elements or changing pages (e.g. in SPAs), **kill** associated ScrollTrigger instances so they don’t run on stale elements:

```javascript
ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t => t.kill());
// or kill by the id assigned to the ScrollTrigger in its config object like {id: "my-id", ...}
ScrollTrigger.getById("my-id")?.kill();
```

In React, use the `useGSAP()` hook (@gsap/react NPM package) to ensure proper cleanup automatically, or manually kill in a cleanup (e.g. in useEffect return) when the component unmounts.
