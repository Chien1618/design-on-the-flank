## Easing

### CustomEase

Custom easing curves (cubic-bezier or SVG path). Use when a built-in ease is not enough. Basic usage is covered in gsap-core; register when using:

```javascript
gsap.registerPlugin(CustomEase);
const ease = CustomEase.create("name", ".17,.67,.83,.67");
gsap.to(".el", { x: 100, ease: ease, duration: 1 });
```

### EasePack

Adds more named eases (e.g. SlowMo, RoughEase, ExpoScaleEase). Register and use the ease names in tweens.

### CustomWiggle

Wiggle/shake easing. Use when a value should “wiggle” (multiple oscillations).

### CustomBounce

Bounce-style easing with configurable strength.
